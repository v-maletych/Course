          <p class="card-text">Widely used and popular in the community of programmers, Python is known to run on almost all operating systems and platforms including the minor ones. <br />
            Major API-powered services in addition to libraries have Python wrappers or bindings which allow this programming language to interface with those services freely or use those libraries directly. <br />
            Even though it isnâ€™t the fastest language, the versatility Python provides makes up for the lack of its speed. It also is known to bridge the existing gap between businesses and developers.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Every budding engineer must be ready to write. Yes, write! From code to writing computer programs, you will require in-depth knowledge of a programming language. <br />
            Automation is the way forward for every sector and every domain, be it storage of information or drawing  of the previous years. <br />
            Programming languages such as Python, Java, C++ are age-old languages that have been quite popular amongst both beginners and professionals. <br />
            However various new programming languages have made way into the computer world. These languages are used in web applications, mobile applications, game development, distributed system, etc.</p>

          <p class="card-text">Around the world, millions of analysts and data researchers use R Programming to take care of their most difficult issues in the fields running from computational science to extensive marketing. <br />
            R Programming, or R, has turned into the most prevalent language for data science and a fundamental tool for Finance and analytics-driven organizations, for example, Google, Facebook, and LinkedIn. <br />
            R is a language and environment for statistical computing and design. It is a GNU venture which is like the S language and environment which was created at Bell Laboratories by John Chambers and Associates. <br />
            R Programming has brought revolutionary modifications in Big Data Analytics and other aspects of data analytics and data science. R Programming can be considered as an alternate execution of S. <br />
            There are some dynamic contrasts. However, much code composed for S runs unaltered under R.
